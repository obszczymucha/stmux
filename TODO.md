# TODO

1. Consider creating a session if it's bookmarked and not active.  
   This could be a setting in the session configuration yaml  
   (e.g. `auto_create = true`).

2. Add a setting in the session configuration yaml to specify the startup program.
   Things to consider: is it possible to start shell and then nvim?

3. Add recent-session set option and plug it into the scripts.
