# TODO

1. Add 'session save' feature.
2. `tm` script should call 'session save'.
3. Add 'active' to window config and utilise it.
4. Utilise 'active' for a pane.
5. A recent session that is not saved appears in the all session picker - remove it.
6. Remove all the NO_CD crap. Maybe have default environment settings. We need a config for that.
