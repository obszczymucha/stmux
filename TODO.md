# TODO

1. Add 'session save' feature.
2. `tm` script should call 'session save'.
3. Refactor for testability/safety (decouple side effects from logic).
4. Add 'active' to window config and utilise it.
5. Utilise 'active' for a pane.
6. Add 'no-recent-tracking' flag in the config to not track a session (currently all background tasks do it).
